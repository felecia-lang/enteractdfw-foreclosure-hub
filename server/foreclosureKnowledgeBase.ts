## Texas Foreclosure Process

### Timeline Overview
Texas uses a non-judicial foreclosure process, which is faster than judicial foreclosure:

1. **Day 0: Notice of Default** - You receive a Notice of Default from your lender after missing mortgage payments (typically 3-4 months behind)

2. **Days 1-20: Grace Period** - You have at least 20 days from the Notice of Default to cure the default by paying all past-due amounts plus fees

3. **Day 20+: Notice of Acceleration** - If you don't cure the default, the lender sends a Notice of Acceleration, declaring the entire loan balance due immediately

4. **Day 21+: Notice of Sale** - The lender posts a Notice of Sale at the county courthouse at least 21 days before the foreclosure sale date. The notice must also be filed with the county clerk and mailed to you.

5. **Foreclosure Sale Date** - The property is sold at public auction on the first Tuesday of the month at the county courthouse, typically between 10 AM and 4 PM

### Total Timeline
From Notice of Default to foreclosure sale: **Approximately 120-150 days (4-5 months)**

## Homeowner Rights in Texas

### Right to Cure
- You have the right to cure the default by paying all past-due amounts plus fees within 20 days of receiving the Notice of Default
- This stops the foreclosure process immediately

### Right to Redeem
- Texas does NOT have a post-sale redemption period for non-judicial foreclosures
- Once the property is sold at auction, you lose all ownership rights
- This makes acting quickly even more critical

### Right to Reinstate
- Before the foreclosure sale, you can reinstate your loan by paying all past-due amounts, fees, and costs
- This is different from paying off the entire loan balance

### Right to Contest
- You can file a lawsuit to stop the foreclosure if you believe the lender violated Texas foreclosure laws
- Common grounds: improper notice, incorrect amounts, or failure to follow legal procedures

## Options to Avoid Foreclosure

### 1. Loan Modification
- **What it is**: Permanently changing the terms of your mortgage (lower interest rate, extended term, principal reduction)
- **Best for**: Homeowners with temporary financial hardship who can afford modified payments
- **Timeline**: Apply immediately; can take 30-90 days for approval
- **Pros**: Keep your home, lower monthly payments
- **Cons**: May extend loan term, not guaranteed approval

### 2. Forbearance Agreement
- **What it is**: Temporary pause or reduction in mortgage payments
- **Best for**: Homeowners facing short-term financial hardship (job loss, medical emergency)
- **Timeline**: Request immediately; typically 3-12 months
- **Pros**: Immediate relief, stops foreclosure temporarily
- **Cons**: Payments are still owed later, may need lump sum repayment

### 3. Repayment Plan
- **What it is**: Adding past-due amounts to your regular monthly payments over time
- **Best for**: Homeowners who can afford slightly higher payments
- **Timeline**: Negotiate with lender; typically 6-12 months
- **Pros**: Catch up gradually, keep your home
- **Cons**: Higher monthly payments during repayment period

### 4. Short Sale
- **What it is**: Selling your home for less than you owe with lender approval
- **Best for**: Homeowners who are underwater (owe more than home value) or can't afford payments
- **Timeline**: 60-120 days from listing to closing
- **Pros**: Avoid foreclosure, less credit damage than foreclosure, may qualify for relocation assistance
- **Cons**: Still lose your home, may owe deficiency balance, credit impact

### 5. Cash Sale to Investor (EnterActDFW)
- **What it is**: Selling your home quickly to a real estate investor for cash
- **Best for**: Homeowners who need to sell fast (less than 30 days until foreclosure sale)
- **Timeline**: 7-14 days from offer to closing
- **Pros**: Fast closing, no repairs needed, certainty of sale, avoid foreclosure on credit
- **Cons**: May receive below market value, still lose your home

### 6. Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure
- **What it is**: Voluntarily transferring ownership to the lender to avoid foreclosure
- **Best for**: Homeowners who can't sell and can't afford payments
- **Timeline**: 30-60 days
- **Pros**: Avoid foreclosure process, less credit damage
- **Cons**: Lose your home, may still owe deficiency balance

### 7. Bankruptcy
- **What it is**: Filing Chapter 13 (reorganization) or Chapter 7 (liquidation) bankruptcy
- **Best for**: Homeowners with significant debt beyond the mortgage
- **Timeline**: Immediate automatic stay stops foreclosure; Chapter 13 takes 3-5 years
- **Pros**: Stops foreclosure immediately, may allow you to catch up on payments
- **Cons**: Severe credit impact, legal fees, not a long-term solution if you can't afford payments

## Common Foreclosure Questions

### How many mortgage payments can I miss before foreclosure?
Typically, lenders initiate foreclosure after 3-4 missed payments (90-120 days delinquent). However, this varies by lender.

### Will foreclosure ruin my credit?
Yes, foreclosure severely damages your credit score (typically 200-400 points) and stays on your credit report for 7 years. However, a short sale or deed in lieu has less impact.

### Can I stay in my home during foreclosure?
Yes, you can stay in your home until the foreclosure sale is complete. After the sale, the new owner can begin eviction proceedings.

### What happens to my belongings after foreclosure?
You must remove all personal belongings before or immediately after the foreclosure sale. Anything left behind may be disposed of by the new owner.

### Can I get my home back after foreclosure?
In Texas, there is NO post-sale redemption period for non-judicial foreclosures. Once sold, you cannot get your home back.

### What is a deficiency judgment?
If your home sells for less than you owe, the lender may sue you for the difference (deficiency balance). Texas law allows deficiency judgments in some cases.

### How does foreclosure affect my taxes?
Forgiven debt (deficiency balance) may be considered taxable income by the IRS. Consult a tax professional.

### Can I rent my home to avoid foreclosure?
Renting out your home doesn't stop foreclosure if you're not making mortgage payments. The rental income might help you afford payments, but you need lender approval to rent a property you're behind on.
